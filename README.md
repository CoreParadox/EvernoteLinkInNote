# EvernoteLinkInNote

Currently Inactive, Contact me if you're interested in maintaining this.

This is just a simple app to easily genereate a jump for evernote notes, easily copy and paste into your note and style them how you please, and they should work.

For example, if you have a rather large note and wanted to link the word "conclusion" to the bottom of your page where you have a header that said "conclusion" this app generates html that you can easily copy and paste into your note. Then you simply click the link and it will automatically scroll to the destination that the app generated!

Obviously, I can't guarantee that this application will continue to create working links as Evernote changes, but as of now it works.
